# Harvesting Predictions: ARIMA Models in Telanganaâ€™s Agriculture ðŸŒ¾
The following repository illustrates the implementation of ARIMA model over crop produce in the state of telangana.

### ðŸ“š About the files
Our repository is organized as follows:

1. **ICRISAT-<crop_name>.xls**: These files are your gateway to comprehensive datasets, meticulously compiled over the years for various districts. Each grain of data adds to the bigger picture of Telangana's agricultural landscape.

2. **yearly_<crop_name>_prod.xls**: These files present a cleaned dataset, showcasing the yearly trends of crop production. They are the result of careful data cleaning and preprocessing, ready for analysis and modeling.

3. **ICRISAT-DATA COLLECTION.ipynb**: Ever wondered how we transformed the raw data into a clean, analysis-ready format? This Jupyter notebook walks you through the entire data cleaning process, step by step.

4. **FINAL ICRISAT PROCEDURE <crop_name>.ipynb**: These files are where the magic happens! Here, we implement ARIMA models on selected crops, turning data into valuable predictions.
